## Mission objectives 

Now is the time to take stock of everything we've learned so far and  putting it into practice! 

## The Mission

In this exercise we must create a Streaming site in html / css, javascript and php.

We took inspiration from Netflix.

### Must-have features

- A session system: registration, connection / disconnection.
- Different rights: registrants have the right to comment on the content. You can add other rights depending on the different types of users.
- A carousel with videos that will not be hosted by you, a simple link to the Youtube trailer will suffice
- Include a search bar and sort by filters
- Make a secure code
- Deploy the site. PHP is not supported by github, find free alternatives.

### Nice-to-have features

- Management of lost passwords.
- Back office for user and comment management (CRUD).
- Create a page or section that displays the top movies with the movie db API.
- Integrate a newsletter with Mailchimp.

### Steps

1. We are using Trello and Coggle for the organisation
2. We've used figma to do a model and analyse the structure of Netflix (style of the header/footer,on wich page are they reused, when does the bg-color change...)
3.
